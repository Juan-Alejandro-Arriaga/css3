            We walked through the door of our new apartment
            We're laughing the whole time
            I hold your hands in mine, we share a smile
            A box in hand and you in the other
            You smell like lavender, like my mother
            And then, the lights turn green
            What have I done?
            Have I made a mistake?
            'Cause I can't remember why I feel this way
            My life flashes by, as I drive away
            My home is not my home no more
            My home is now my grave
            The gifts you gave me, I'll keep them safe
            Though bittersweet in their aftertaste
            So many songs that'll never sound the same
            Stuffed animals that used to light up the room
            Felt like how I fell out of love with you
            Out of sight, but I see you everyday
        </div>
        <div class="div-2">
            Indifferent to the people I detest
            But, it harms me in a way that even I cannot detect
            In my own flesh and blood (in my own flesh and blood)
            I think I've had enough (I think I've had enough, I've had enough)
            I welcome death with open arms
            Like an old friend I haven't seen
            Since I was young, when young was old
            When Daddy did terrible things
            Maybe I'd feel better then, when I leave you like this
            (Don't let me leave, don't let me leave)
            (Don't let me leave it all behind)
            While some days are not that bad
            And even pleasant one might say
            I can't control the thoughts I have
            I can't control the present wave of emotion
            Anxiously hoping for something or someone
            For anything at all
            I can't imagine a life without familiarity
            I can't imagine what it's like to live
            With certainty, I like to rewatch movies
            So I know the end of every scene
            I know the end of everything I do
            Because I won't ever leave my room
            It's safer here, safety's all I want and all I need
            Buried my issues here, deep within the walls and in my dreams
            In my own atmosphere is where I'll die
            So, let me die in peace
            I'm on my final breath, my final steps
            I've never felt so free
            <p>
