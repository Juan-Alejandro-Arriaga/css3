            I should've told you

            I should've told you when I had the chance
            Lost in the memories we don't have
            I wanted to hold you in hopeless romance
            Mmm, you fade like a ghost
            I've been from London to Aberdeen (wow)
            Inside a coupe and from inside a private limousine (cool?)
            Do you think it really matters if I wear designer? (No)
            'Cause I don't, if I don't have her, what's the point of finer things? (Things)
            I'm ex nihilo, like Augustine (amen)
